## Overview

### Purpose

The Paso Robles Food Co-op is a non-profit organization dedicated to building a community-owned grocery store that prioritizes local, fresh, and healthy food. This referral program is essential to achieving their mission by increasing membership. By incentivizing current members to spread the word, the co-op can accelerate the path to opening its doors, providing the community with increased access to high-quality, locally sourced food. This will have a significant positive impact by supporting local farmers and producers, strengthening the local economy, and improving the overall health and well-being of the community.
